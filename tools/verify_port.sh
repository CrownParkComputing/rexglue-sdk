#   tools/verify_port.sh [seconds] ["<input script>"]
#
# Written because a port was called working off a single frame of its intro
# while the actual game was a flat red screen. The checks are the failures that
# have actually happened on this estate:
#
#   FLAT      - one colour fills the frame (a clear with nothing drawn on it).
#               This is the "all red" / "all black" failure, and a run can be
#               entirely flat while the log has no errors at all. This is the
#               only check that is SAFE to assert automatically.
#   NO-DRAWS  - the guest issued no draws for that frame.
#
# Everything else is REPORTED, not judged. A brightness or channel-balance rule
# cannot tell a broken frame from deliberate art: Alien Breed's menus are dark
# blue on black and tripped both a "too dark" and a "one channel dominates"
# test while rendering perfectly. Frames are listed with their numbers so a
# human decides; the tool only claims what a solid-colour frame proves.
